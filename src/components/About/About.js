                <p style={{ fontFamily: 'consolas' }}> <span className='display-6'>Hello!!!</span>Good to see you here. I am pipul boddyo. My nearby persons also called me 'utsho'. I want to do something better what would help people and I can enjoy this journey. You know web is the biggest platform to connect peoples and make the world more small. <br />
                    So my goal is to work with bigger company and make the web more easier. I am doing hard work to achieve this goal. I spend most of time on web-development beside my academic studies. I also try to continue competitive programming </p>
                <h3 className='text-center'>Thank you</h3>
