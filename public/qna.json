        "question": "What is the Difference between authorization and authentication?",
        "ans": "Authentication is the process of identifying someone by assuring that the person is real or not. Authentication does not ensure what tasks under a process the person can do. It mostly identifies who the person or system is actually. On the other hand, Authorization is the process of granting someone to do something. It means it a way to check if the user has permission to use a resource or not. The authorization usually works with authentication so that the system could know who is accessing the information."
